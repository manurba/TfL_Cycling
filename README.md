# TfL_Cycling
 
The aim of this problem is to better understand the current status of the TfL short-term rental cycles. This would allow the development of a strategy for private companies wanting to break into the market of short-term rental bikes by providing usage patterns of the current fleet of TfL.

Different types of usages will be analysed, as well as the profile of customers, the operational concerns and supply chain management of the fleet.


## Data Source

Data has been extracted from the official TfL website (https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/) under the `usage-stats` section for dates between 2019 and 2021.


## Workflow

1. Performing exploratory analysis on the dataset
2. Identifying possible data science use cases with the data
3. Selecting a use case and prototype a model to demonstrate the application of data
science to solving the problem
4. Making recommendations for the potential client
